The website is built with HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript. </p> <a href="https://github.com/lorandhajos/GroupF-term1" class="text-primary">GitHub link</a> <h4 class="font-bold mt-5 text-xl">Gemorskos</h4> <p class="mb-3 text-lg"> A more complex website for a fictional company, an online newspaper company. The website uses a MySQL database, Bootstrap and is built with HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript. </p> <p class="text-lg"> The focus of this project was on the back-end, and the underlying infrastructure. </p> <a href="https://github.com/lorandhajos/GroupC-term2" class="text-primary">GitHub link</a> <h4 class="font-bold mt-5 text-xl">Battlebot</h4> <p class="text-lg"> A maze solving robot. The robot uses an Arduino and an array of line sensors to solve a maze. The robot is programmed in C++. </p> <a href="https://github.com/lorandhajos/GroupC-term3" class="text-primary">GitHub link</a> <h4 class="font-bold mt-5 text-xl">Innovate</h4> <p class="mb-3 text-lg"> As part of the Innovate project, we had to come up with an innovative idea and create a prototype. We created a prototype for a communication module for smartphones that would allow users to communicate with each other without the need for a cellular network. </p> <p class="mb-3 text-lg"> The prototype was built with an Arduino and a LoRa module inside a 3D printed case. It used a custom Android application to communicate with the module. </p> <p class="text-lg"> The low level code for the Arduino was written in C++. The Android application was written in React Native using JavaScript that uses a custom Java module. </p> <a href="https://github.com/lorandhajos/GroupD-term4" class="text-primary">GitHub link</a> </div> <h3 class="font-bold my-3 text-2xl">Year 2</h3> <div> <h4 class="font-bold text-xl">AIS Data</h4> <p class="mb-3 text-lg"> First time working with a real client. The client wanted a database that would store large amounts of AIS data. The requirements were later expanded to include a web application that would allow users to view and filter the data. </p> <p class="text-lg"> The database was built with MongoDB, the web application was built with React, and the back-end was built with Python. </p> <h4 class="font-bold mt-5 text-xl">Bigshopper</h4> <p class="text-lg"> A web scraper for a well known online store in the Netherlands with a frontend to display information. The application uses a Postgres database, and is built with Django, and Python. </p> </div> </div> </article> <article> <h2 class="font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-2xl text-primary">Competitions</h2> <div class="flex flex-col"> <div> <h4 class="font-bold text-xl">Infoprog 2019</h4> <p class="mb-3 text-lg"> A programming competition for high school students national and international. The competition was held in two rounds. A correspondence round and a second round in-person at real-time. I placed 1st nationally and 3rd internationally. </p> <h4 class="font-bold text-xl">XII. Természettudományi Triatlon (2019)</h4> <p class="mb-3 text-lg"> A competition for high school students in the fields of mathematics, physics, and computer science. Teams of 3 competed to solve the most challenges in a limited time. The competition was held in two rounds. A correspondence round and a second round in-person at real-time. Our team placed 2nd. </p> <h4 class="font-bold text-xl">XIII. Természettudományi Triatlon (2020)</h4> <p class="text-lg"> This year the competition was held online due to the pandemic. The competition was held in two rounds. This time our team placed 1st. </p> </div> </div> </article> <article> <h2 class="font-bold mt-6 text-2xl text-primary">Personal Projects</h2> <p class="mb-3"> Here's a list of some of my personal projects, in approximate chronological order. </p> <div class="flex"> <div> <h3 class="font-bold text-xl">Questionnaire</h3> <p class="mb-3 text-lg"> When I was 15, my sister asked me to create a website for her. I was already familiar with the process of building a website so I accepted. She wanted a website to conduct a university experiment. The project had a tight deadline and I had to do schoolwork in parallel. The website was built with HTML, PHP, CSS and used a MySQL database. </p> <h3 class="font-bold mt-5 text-xl">Spotify song downloader</h3> <p class="mb-3 text-lg"> The name is a bit of a misnomer. It essentially uses the Spotify API to get a list of songs from my playlists and finds them on YouTube for download. The reason why I made this small app is to skip the Spotify ads and let me listen to them offline. Later this was the basis of a mobile app that I used to stream my music. It is written in Python. </p> <h3 class="font-bold mt-5 text-xl">Stars</h3> <p class="mb-3 text-lg"> When I found out about OpenCV I wanted to try it out. I decided to make a small program that would detect stars in an image taken with a very long exposure and find constellations. The program uses OpenCV to detect stars, and then uses a recursive algorithm to find constellations. The program is written in Python. </p> <h3 class="font-bold mt-5 text-xl">Price tracker</h3> <p class="mb-3 text-lg"> I wanted to track prices of PC components, because I was planning on building a new PC. I decided to make a small program that would track prices of components on a website and send me an email when the price drops below a certain threshold. The program is written in Python. </p> <h3 class="font-bold mt-5 text-xl">Radish Shooter + Salted Radish</h3> <p class="text-lg"> I wanted to learn C++ so I decided to make a game engine and a game to go with it. I named the game engine Salted Radish and the game Radish Shooter. The game engine uses OpenGL and SDL2. The game is a multiplayer isometric shooter. The engine and game is written in C++. Both the game engine and the game are still in development. </p> </div> </div> </article> </main> </div> <script src="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@latest/dist/ionicons.js"></script> </body></html>
