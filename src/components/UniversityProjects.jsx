          <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5">Innovate</h4>
          <p className="text-lg mb-3">
            As part of the Innovate project, we had to come up with an innovative idea and create a prototype. We created a prototype for a communication module for smartphones that would allow users to communicate with each other without the need for a cellular network.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-3">
            The prototype was built with an Arduino and a LoRa module inside a 3D printed case. It used a custom Android application to communicate with the module.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            The low level code for the Arduino was written in C++. The Android application was written in React Native using JavaScript that uses a custom Java module.

          <p className="text-lg mb-3">
            First time working with a real client. The client wanted a database that would store large amounts of AIS data. The requirements were later expanded to include a web application that would allow users to view and filter the data.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            The database was built with MongoDB, the web application was built with React, and the back-end was built with Python.
